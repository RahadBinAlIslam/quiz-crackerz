      <h2>Q&A</h2>
      <h3>Q: What is the purpose of react router?</h3>
      <p>
        Ans: The purpose of react router is to define routes for a multiple page
        web application. It makes browsing seamless as the website becomes a
        single page application rather than waiting for each page to load.
      </p>
      <h3>Q: How does context API work?</h3>
      <p>
        Ans: Context API works by enabling the user to pass multiple values very
        easily through writing one single line of code rather than using
        useEffect and writing many lines of codes.
      </p>
      <h3>Write a few sentences about useRef.</h3>
      <p>
        Ans: useRef is a React Hook that lets you reference a value thatâ€™s not
        needed for rendering.
